## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free project
2. In the **SQL Editor**, run the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial.sql`
3. This creates all tables, RLS policies, and seeds 33 hotels, 4 airlines, and default settings

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Edit `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

Find these in your Supabase project: **Settings → API**

### 3. Create Your First Admin User

In **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users**, click "Add user":
- Email: `admin@fasttravels.pk`
- Password: your choice

Then in the **SQL Editor**, link the user to `staff_users`:

```sql
INSERT INTO staff_users (id, name, username, role, permission, status)
SELECT id, 'Admin', 'admin', 'Admin', 'Full Access', 'Active'
FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@fasttravels.pk';
```
